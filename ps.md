# Python Exercises Learn - Problem Solving & Debugging Guide

## CRITICAL RULE: Question Uniqueness

**ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT**: Every single question must be TRULY UNIQUE. 

### What is NOT allowed:
- ❌ Same question pattern with different numbers (e.g., "Result of bool([46])?" vs "Result of bool([39])?")
- ❌ Same question with different variable names (e.g., "What is type(data)?" vs "What is type(val)?")
- ❌ Same concept tested with only numeric variations
- ❌ Any form of pattern repetition that makes questions feel identical

### What IS required:
- ✅ Each question must test a DIFFERENT concept or skill
- ✅ Each question must have a UNIQUE learning objective
- ✅ Questions should cover diverse aspects of Python, not just variations
- ✅ No two questions should feel like "the same question with different numbers"

### Implementation Strategy:
1. Start with Level 1 (first 100 questions) - ensure ALL are unique
2. Complete and verify Level 1 before moving to Level 2
3. Each level must have 100 truly unique questions
4. Progress through all 10 levels systematically

### Current Status:
- Level 1: ✅ COMPLETED - 100 truly unique questions (no number/variable variations)
- Level 2: ✅ COMPLETED - 100 truly unique questions (no number/variable variations)
- Level 3: ✅ COMPLETED - 100 truly unique questions (no number/variable variations)
- Level 4: ✅ COMPLETED - 100 truly unique questions (no number/variable variations)
- Levels 5-10: PENDING - Will be completed after Level 4 is verified and approved

### Verification Process:
Before moving to the next level:
1. Review all questions in the current level
2. Ensure no two questions test the same concept with just number/variable changes
3. Verify each question teaches something distinct
4. Get user approval before proceeding

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Questions repeating with different numbers
**Solution**: Rewrite to test different concepts entirely, not just change numbers.

### Issue: Questions feel too similar
**Solution**: Each question must have a unique learning objective and test different Python features.

## Notes
- Last updated: Level 3 completed with 100 truly unique questions
- Level 1 Details:
  - Each question tests a DIFFERENT concept
  - No variations like "bool([46])?" vs "bool([39])?" - those are the SAME question
  - Questions cover: types, variables, strings, comments, conversions, arithmetic, string methods
  - All 100 questions are static (no parameter variations)
- Level 2 Details:
  - Each question tests a DIFFERENT concept
  - No number/variable variations of the same question
  - Questions cover: arithmetic operations, math functions, order of operations, type conversions, string vs numeric ops, comparisons, logical operators, membership/identity operators, complex expressions
  - All 100 questions are static (no parameter variations)
- Level 3 Details:
  - Each question tests a DIFFERENT concept
  - No number/variable variations of the same question
  - Questions cover: boolean logic, comparison operators, identity vs equality, chained comparisons, membership operators, truthiness/falsiness, conditional keywords, ternary operator, short-circuit evaluation, complex boolean expressions
  - All 100 questions are static (no parameter variations)
- Level 4 Details:
  - Each question tests a DIFFERENT concept
  - No number/variable variations of the same question
  - Questions cover: range basics, range operations, loop keywords (break, continue, pass), for loops, while loops, enumerate and zip, list comprehensions, dictionary/set comprehensions, generator expressions, advanced iteration (map, filter, iter)
  - All 100 questions are static (no parameter variations)
- Next step: User review and approval of Level 4, then proceed to Level 5
