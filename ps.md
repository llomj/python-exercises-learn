# Python Exercises Learn - Problem Solving & Debugging Guide

## CRITICAL RULE: Question Uniqueness

**ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT**: Every single question must be TRULY UNIQUE. 

### What is NOT allowed:
- ❌ Same question pattern with different numbers (e.g., "Result of bool([46])?" vs "Result of bool([39])?")
- ❌ Same question with different variable names (e.g., "What is type(data)?" vs "What is type(val)?")
- ❌ Same concept tested with only numeric variations
- ❌ Any form of pattern repetition that makes questions feel identical

### What IS required:
- ✅ Each question must test a DIFFERENT concept or skill
- ✅ Each question must have a UNIQUE learning objective
- ✅ Questions should cover diverse aspects of Python, not just variations
- ✅ No two questions should feel like "the same question with different numbers"

### Implementation Strategy:
1. Start with Level 1 (first 100 questions) - ensure ALL are unique
2. Complete and verify Level 1 before moving to Level 2
3. Each level must have 100 truly unique questions
4. Progress through all 10 levels systematically

### Current Status:
- Level 1: ✅ COMPLETED - 100 truly unique questions (no number/variable variations)
- Level 2: ✅ COMPLETED - 100 truly unique questions (no number/variable variations)
- Level 3: ✅ COMPLETED - 100 truly unique questions (no number/variable variations)
- Level 4: ✅ COMPLETED - 100 truly unique questions (no number/variable variations)
- Level 5: ✅ COMPLETED - 100 truly unique questions (no number/variable variations)
- Level 6: ✅ COMPLETED - 100 truly unique questions (no number/variable variations)
- Level 7: ✅ COMPLETED - 100 truly unique questions (no number/variable variations)
- Level 8: ✅ COMPLETED - 100 truly unique questions (no number/variable variations)
- Level 9: ✅ COMPLETED - 100 truly unique questions (no number/variable variations)
- Level 10: ✅ COMPLETED - 100 truly unique questions (no number/variable variations)

🎉 **ALL 1000 QUESTIONS COMPLETE!** 🎉

### Verification Process:
Before moving to the next level:
1. Review all questions in the current level
2. Ensure no two questions test the same concept with just number/variable changes
3. Verify each question teaches something distinct
4. Get user approval before proceeding

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Questions repeating with different numbers
**Solution**: Rewrite to test different concepts entirely, not just change numbers.

### Issue: Questions feel too similar
**Solution**: Each question must have a unique learning objective and test different Python features.

## URGENT: Code Snippet Indentation Issue
**CRITICAL**: Code snippets in questions MUST have proper 4-space Python indentation. Currently, code appears without indentation, making it unreadable. This is a blocking issue that must be fixed immediately.

## Current UI Issues
- Code panel too small (needs 3x larger, e.g., max-h-[70vh])
- Code panel background white/light instead of matching dark logic panel
- Code panel scrolls horizontal instead of vertical for long code
- Code snippets lack proper Python indentation (appear in one row, not formatted like real code) - **URGENT FIX NEEDED**

## Solutions Implemented
- Updated SW cache version for refresh
- Added random mode button in quiz view only
- Implemented question display with syntax highlighting for code questions

## Solutions Needed
- Increase code panel size significantly
- Match code panel background to dark theme
- Ensure vertical scrolling priority
- Add function to format code snippets with proper indentation (newlines and spaces)
- Detect and format code in question strings for display

## TODO
- Optimize bundle size with code splitting
- Add proper error handling for API calls
- Improve PWA offline experience
- Add more interactive features
