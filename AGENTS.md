# Python Exercises Learn - AI Agent Operational Rules

## 1. Genome Checkpoint (STRICT STATE)
- **Current Progress**: 1000 / 1000 Questions
- **Last Fulfilled ID**: 1000
- **Uniqueness Level**: HIGH VARIANCE MANDATED.
- **Rule**: Every question must be a unique logical challenge. Repetitive patterns are considered a failure of educational integrity.

## 2. Consent & Modification Rules
- **Explicit Consent**: No changes shall be made to the source code without explicit user approval.
- **Layout Preservation**: Do not deviate from the existing visual identity.
- **Incremental Updates**: Keep updates as minimal as possible while satisfying requirements.

## 3. Glossary & Educational Integrity
- **Glossary Source of Truth**: The `glossary.md` file is the master reference.
- **Consistency Rule**: All definitions must be consistent with `glossary.md`.
- **Debugging Reference**: Agents must always consult `ps.md` for debugging information and urgent issues.

## 4. The 1,000-Question Genome Goal
- **Completion Task**: Reach exactly 1,000 high-quality Python questions.
- **Status**: ACHIEVED.
- **Diversity Rule**: Use at least 10 logic templates per stage to ensure students encounter varied syntax and conceptual challenges.

## 5. Testing and Deployment Rules
- **Testing Requirement**: Agents must always run tests before telling the user that the app should deploy successfully.
- **Layout Preservation**: Agents must never change the layout of the app when making changes unless explicitly asked by the user.
- **Debugging Reference**: Agents must always consult ps.md for debugging information.
- **Browser Testing**: Agents must always test the app in the browser first to ensure it works and opens correctly before pushing to Git.
- **User Consent for Commits**: Agents must always ask the user for approval before committing to Git.
